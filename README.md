Intra and Inter class transferability matrices.  The element at [i,j]  in Inter class transferability matrix represents the value of p_{i,j}. Similarly,  the element at $[i,j]$  in intra class transferability matrix  represents the value of $e_{i,j}$. The larger value for p_{i,j} and lower value for e_{i,j} are preferred.
